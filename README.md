# SiriKit
Integrating SiriKit to your iOS app

you can add this project to your app if you want to integrate SiriKit into it. This kit includes making calls, accesing photos and maybe requesting a ride on uber or lyft. However you will need to do necesary changes to integrate it fully into your app. Remember to set all access requests in info.plist of all the iphone services you will be using. 

Happy Coding!!
